## Fańtastïca

This app is made to help students track their performance and important annoucement made by the school. Students will be able to receive annoucement made by the school on a regular basis, so this app will be there to help the students even if they were to forget or missed out some important information made by the school. Other than that, students will also be able to keep track of their grades.

# Design Process

This app is design for students to track their academic matters, so the design is very minimalistic. This app serves as a platform for the students to access their academic materials, so I did not make it very interactive as that could be quite tiring to see just to access some simple matters.
